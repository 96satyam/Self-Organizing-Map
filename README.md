Here's a sample README for your Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) project on GitHub:

Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for Fraud Detection
This project demonstrates the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for detecting potential frauds in credit card applications. The SOM is an unsupervised neural network used here to identify patterns in data that may indicate fraudulent behavior.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Credit_Card_Applications.csv. It contains information about various credit card applications with the final column indicating if the application was approved (1) or rejected (0).

🛠️ Project Structure
The project follows these steps:

Import Libraries: Import necessary Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and pandas.
Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset.
Separate features (X) and target labels (y).
Apply feature scaling using MinMaxScaler.
Training the SOM:
Use the MiniSom library to initialize a 10x10 SOM grid.
Train the SOM using 100 iterations.
Visualizing the Results:
Plot the distance map of the SOM to identify clusters and anomalies.
Mark different points based on the approval status of applications.
Fraud Detection:
Identify the winning nodes for fraud mapping.
Retrieve the potential frauds from the dataset based on the trained SOM.
🔍 Key Code Highlights
Feature Scaling
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
X = sc.fit_transform(X)
Training the SOM
python
Copy code
from minisom import MiniSom
som = MiniSom(x=10, y=10, input_len=15, sigma=1.0, learning_rate=0.5)
som.random_weights_init(X)
som.train_random(data=X, num_iteration=100)
Visualization
python
Copy code
from pylab import bone, pcolor, colorbar, plot, show
bone()
pcolor(som.distance_map().T)
colorbar()
Fraud Detection
python
Copy code
mappings = som.win_map(X)
frauds = np.concatenate((mappings[(8, 5)], mappings[(7, 4)], mappings[(4, 4)]), axis=0)
frauds = sc.inverse_transform(frauds)
📊 Results
The project successfully identified potential frauds based on patterns in the dataset. These results were visualized using a heatmap, where anomalies were highlighted based on the SOM distance map.
